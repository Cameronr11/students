I am very interested in learning more about game development but have not had much of an opportunity to research it in an academic setting.
I don't have an extremely strict or focused idea for what I want to research, but I think it would be interesting to see how different companies 
or teams use specific tools. One example I can think of is to compare and contrast how a game like Dark Souls uses Lua against a game like Hades,
which also uses Lua but to a larger extent. 

I would also be interested in researching how engines work, and why some teams develop their own engines or use engines that are unconventional or
outdated, such as Helldivers 2 using Autodesk Stingray, which was discontinued in 2018.
