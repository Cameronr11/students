I am a 1st year PhD student in Computer Science. My current research is primarily focused on machine learning with the application area on intelligent transportation system  involving both intelligent vehicles as well as infrastructure. I also have prior experience with NLP and time series analytics. I have been amazed by the recent release of many low parameter, high performing open source LLMs such as DeepSeek, text to speech models like Kokoro and many others. I believe, these models add significant contribution towards democratized and accessible AI. For the project, i am interested in leveraging these open source models with best software engineering practices to develop a semi-automated social media content creating platform or an agent with limited features for a start. The scope of this idea is not concrete yet and subject to change. I would really appriciate your feedbacks.
